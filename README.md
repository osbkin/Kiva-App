# Kiva App 

Kiwa is a SwiftUI-based social application designed to connect users who need assistance with their projects with others willing to help. The app incorporates advanced UI components, robust data handling, and modern design practices to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** SwiftUI
- **Backend Communication:** JSON-based REST APIs
- **Data Storage:** Codable for parsing and encoding JSON
- **Design Adaptability:** Support for light and dark mode using system preferences

## Challenges Solved

- **Custom UI Components:** Building and styling a custom slider in SwiftUI while ensuring responsiveness and state integration.
- **Dark Mode Optimization:** Fine-tuning color schemes for consistency and accessibility in different themes.
- **Data Synchronization:** Ensuring that data fetched from APIs reflects immediately in the UI without performance lags.
